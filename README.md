# 📊 Power BI Report Design – Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (Lab)

This project is part of the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (Cloud Slice)** training series. It demonstrates the process of designing and publishing a multi-page report in Power BI Desktop.

## 🧪 Lab Overview

In this lab, I created a **three-page interactive Power BI report**, configuring visual fields, applying formatting properties, and preparing the report for publication. The final result is published to the Power BI Service, where users can interact with the visuals in the cloud.
